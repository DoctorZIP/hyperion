It is based on experience implementing standard data services in several different organizations.\r\nI've taken the lessons learned from implementing several different frameworks through the years and boiled it down to a framework that\r\nsupports quickly creating data services. I classify this as a \"Simple Service Framework\" to avoid the religious war behind the REST and Restful\r\nservice monikers. This framework supports most general use cases for data services but may not be a good fit for complex use cases, so caveat emptor.\r\n\r\n# Why Another Data Service Framework?\r\nI looked at several different Java based data service frameworks, such as [Spring Data Rest](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/)\r\nand [odata4j](https://code.google.com/p/odata4j/) and found that they had similar attributes:\r\n* Exposed the persistence model directly, with little or no ability to modify the external representation\r\n* Limited support for complex and context specific (insert/update/delete) validations\r\n* Limited support for truly ad-hoc queries and sorts\r\n* No real support for user based visibility\r\n\r\nThis had several problems for the types of use cases I needed to support:\r\n* Allowing data objects to change over time while maintaining backward compatibility using a single endpoint\r\n* Arbitrarily complex ad-hoc queries\r\n* Multi-level sorts\r\n* User based visibility for records and fields\r\n* Validations/referential integrity checks\r\n* Sparse GETs\r\n\r\nHyperion was designed to separate the external API representation of a data object from the underlying persistence model used to store the data. This\r\nhas several advantages:\r\n* The data model can change over time. Since the API model is independent from the persistence model different versions of the API model can be supported. The persistent and \r\nAPI models can evolve independently.\r\n* The persistence mechanism can be changed without impacting the callers.\r\n* The caller can specify the fields to return. The framework will populate only the API fields being requested.\r\n* The caller can specify only changed fields on a write operation. The framework will only populate the persistent fields that were sent in the API model.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Underlying Architecture\r\nEach data object defined in a Hyperion service is called an entity. Each entity is a separate endpoint in the service, each of which support\r\nstandard CRUD operations using POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP operations respectively. Each entity has a single persistent representation\r\nand one or more API representations, specified as versions of that entity API object. Each version of an entity API object has\r\na corresponding translator to covert between the API representation and the persistent representation as well as a validator to\r\nenforce any necessary validation rules for a specific version of an entity.\r\n\r\nTranslation uses a convention over configuration design principle. If a field on the API object has the same name and type\r\nas the field on the persistent object then translation happens automatically. Otherwise some level of configuration needs to\r\nbe done to enable translation for that field. Configuring fields that can be sorted and queried is similar, the assumption is that all fields\r\nare supported unless excluded.\r\n\r\n# Using Hyperion\r\nTBD\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
